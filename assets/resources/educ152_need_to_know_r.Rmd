# Introduction to R  

R is a language and environment for statistical programming and visualization. The R language is similar to S which was designed in the 80s and created by John Chambers. It is part of the [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/), a free software or operating system that respects users' freedom. R was created by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka and since 1997 consists of the _R Core Team_ who write access to the R source.

> "To use R, we’ll need to download two software packages: **Base-R**, and **RStudio**. Base-R is the basic software which contains the R programming language. RStudio is software that makes R programming easier. Of course, they are totally free and open source."

## R script  

- You can write your code in RStudio using an R script which has a .R extension or you can write your code using an R Markdown file which has a .Rmd extension. In this class we will predominantly use R Markdown for lectures and problem sets (homeworks). 
    - The benefits of using [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) is that users can embed code in their text. This lets users create high quality documents, reports, presentations, etc.  
    - Let's practice opening an R script. In the far left corner click on the File tab and then select New file and then R Script  

<br>
       ![](images/r-script.png) 

- A hashtag `#` in R has a special meaning. If you use a `#` in an R script it will not be evaluated as code. In other words, R will ignore whatever is followed by the hashtag.  
    - It is important to note that a hashtag in R Markdown has a different meaning. If you want to include a `#` in your code, make sure it is done in a code chunk. 

## RStudio user interface    
![](images/panels.png)
<br>  

1. The source pane is where your code goes. You can think of this pane as a working document where you can create and edit your scripts.  
1. The environment pane displays all of the data objects from your current R session. This can include vectors, matrices, and dataframes.  
1. The console pane is where your code is evaluated. The greater than sign `>` is a prompt that lets you know that R is ready to evaluate new code.  
1. The files, packages, help, and plots panel provides you with a lot of information.  
    - You can set the working directory and/or navigate to other directories using the files tab.  
    - The plots tab allows you to view your plots.
    - In the packages tab you are able to view a list of packages installed and/or identify if they are currently loaded.  
    - The help tab lets you search for R functions. You can type the name of the function in the search window or type a question mark `?` followed by the name of the function in the console.  


*Credit: [The Four RStudio Windows](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/the-four-rstudio-windows.html) YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R*  

- R Markdown outputs  
    - There are various R Markdown outputs which include html, pdf, word document, and [many more](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html).  

- R code chunks  
    - R code chunks are where you write your code  
    - You can insert a code chunk with the keyboard shortcut (cmd + option + i)  
    - Alternatively you can insert a code chunk by clicking on the `+`c insert tab and then click on the R.

# R practice

<br>  

**Simple arithmetic**  

- You can perform simple math operations using these symbols `+, -, *, /, ()`
```{r}
1 + 2  #addition

3 * 4  #multiplication

1 + 2 / 3 * 4 
1 + 2 / (3 * 4) # What is the difference here?  

```


<br>  

## Objects in R 

There are various types of objects available in R (e.g., vectors, lists, matrices, etc.), however the most simple type of object in R is an atomic vector, discussed below.

- Think of an object as anything I assign values to.

**Working with objects**  

- R stores information in "objects"  
- You can assign an object using `<-` or `=`   
- Objects are organized by type or class (we will discuss this in more detail in class).
```{r}

1 + 3
x = 1  
d <- 4 # I prefer this method

p <- 1 + 3

p <- "Patricia"
```


### Vectors 

- A fundamental object in R is a "vector".  
- There are two types of vectors, atomic vectors and recursive vectors or lists, but for the purpose of this introduction, we will briefly review the most common atomic vectors you will encounter (logical, integer, double, and character) and recursive vectors (lists).   

- This is a logical vector or what others refer to as a boolean (TRUE, FALSE, NA).
```{r}
logical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) #logical vector
typeof(logical)
logical

TRUE == 1
FALSE == 1
FALSE == 0
```
  
- This is a double vector which is a subset of a numeric vector. R makes double vectors the default.  
```{r}
doub <- c(3.5, -2, 4) #double vector
typeof(doub)
doub
```
  
- This is an integer vector which is a subset of a numeric vector. Don't worry about the difference between a double and integer vector. Just keep in mind that doubles are approximations.   
```{r}
int <- c(1L, 3L, 2L) #integer vector
typeof(int)
int
```
  
- This is a character vector. Each element of a character vector is a string. Notice how each string is enclosed with quotations. 
```{r}

char <- c("a", "b", "c") #character vector
typeof(char)
char
```

- A list also known as a recursive vector, is a bit more complicated than atomic vectors. Lists can group together other R objects like atomic vectors and lists. 
```{r}
list1 <- list(10:30, "hello", list(TRUE, FALSE))
list1
```

- We can investigate the underlying structure of an R object using the `str()` function. 

**Exercise** 


- Take a few minutes to practice creating vectors.  
- Create a character vector of the names of people in your immediate family.  
- Now create a numeric vector of the ages of people in your immediate family.

<br>

### str() function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?str()

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
str(object, ...)
```

- Function:
  - `str()` compactly display the internal structure of an `R` object.
- Arguments:
  - `object`: any `R` object about which you want to have some information..
  

```{r}
str(list1)
```
- The `str()` function helps us understand the underlying structure of the object `list1` that is a list with 3 elements.  
  - The first element is an integer vector, the second element is a character vector, and the third element is a list of 2 elements, TRUE & FALSE.

**str() using a dataframe**  

- You can use the `str()` function to give us a snapshot of the data and tell us more about it's underlying structure.
```{r echo=FALSE}
load(url("https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.RData"))
```

```{r}
str(df_school)
```

- The `str()` output let's us know that the `df_school` object is a tibble with 21,301 observations and 26 columns. 
- It prints out all columns/variables and tells us what type of atomic vector they are (e.g., chr, int, num). 
- The first few observations of each column is returned as well.

**str() using a vector** 
```{r}
str(df_school$state_code)
```

- The output is a lot shorter. 
- We can see that the variable `state_code` is a character vector with 21301 rows or observations. 

**str() using a function**  

- You could also use the `str()` function to investigate a function. 

```{r}
str(sd)
```

- The output tells us that the object `sd` is a function. 
- The `sd()` function takes two arguments, `x` and `na.rm`.
- Let's do a quick investigation of the `sd()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sd()

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
sd(x, na.rm = FALSE)
```

- Function:
  - `sd()` This function computes the standard deviation of the values in x. If na.rm is TRUE then missing values are removed before computation proceeds.
- Arguments:
  - `x`: a numeric vector or an R object but not a factor coercible to numeric by as.double(x).
  - `na.rm`: logical. Should missing values be removed?

- The help file tells us that the argument `x` has to be a numeric vector. The `na.rm=FALSE` is the default which means missing values are not removed. If we had a vector/variable with missing values we should set the `na.rm=TRUE` to remove missing values. 

**str() and pipes**

- _Note: We will review pipes in more detail in the Tidyverse and Pipes section below, but for now let's review the utility of using pipes with the `str()` function._

```{r echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


- Say we wanted to subset the dataframe and only include private schools and a few columns/variables.


```{r}
df_school %>% select(name, state_code, school_type) %>% filter(school_type == "private")
```

- What is returned is a dataframe with three columns/variables (e.g., `name`, `state_code`, `school_type`) and 3,822 observations (the number of private schools). 

- Now let's run the same code but add the `str()` function at the end.
```{r}
df_school %>% select(name, state_code, school_type) %>% filter(school_type == "private") %>% str()
```

- We get a compact output that details what is being piped in-- three columns and 3822 observations that represent private high schools.

<br>  

## Packages  

> "Many of R’s most useful functions do not come preloaded when you start R, but reside in packages that can be installed on top of R. R packages are similar to libraries in C, C++, and Javascript, packages in Python, and gems in Ruby. An R package bundles together useful functions, help files, and data sets. You can use these functions within your own R code once you load the package they live in."  

- To use a package, you have to install it first and then load it in R.  
- You only have to install a package once, but you may have to update a package periodically.  
- To install a package, use the following R function `install.packages("package name")`  

```{r}
#install.packages("kableExtra")
```

- While you only have to install a package once, you have to load a package in your R session every time.  
- To load a package in R use the following R function `library(package name)`  

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
```


*Credit: [Appendix B: R Packages](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages2.html#packages2) Hands-On Programming with R*  

<br>  

## Data in R

**Loading R data**  

- It is common for packages to come with data. For example the  `dplyr` package includes the `starwars` data set (as a tibble) which comes from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).  
- You can load a data set by typing it's name (ex. `starwars`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#dplyr::starwars
starwars
```
 
- To save the data set in your environment as an object, make sure to assign it `<-` and give it a name.  

```{r}
p_data <- starwars
```

*Credit: [Tidyverse webpage](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)*

<br>  

**Loading other data**  

- We will be working with various data sets in this class.  
- R data sets are stored in `.RData` files.  
- To load a `.RData` file you need to use the `load()` function.  
- Notice the `url()` function below. We use the `url()` function below because we are loading a `.RData` file from the web.  

```{r}
load(url("https://github.com/ozanj/rclass/raw/master/data/recruiting/recruit_school_somevars.RData"))
```
  
*Credit: [.RData files](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/rdata-files.html ) YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R*

<br>  

**Data frames and tibbles**  

> "A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows)" from ([The mpg dataframe](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html))  

- We will be working with a variant of a data frame called a `tibble`.   
- Tibbles are essentially data frames, but have been updated a little bit to make them easier to work with.  
```{r}
typeof(df_school)  
class(df_school)
```
  
- The main differences between a `data.frame` and a `tibble` are the printing and subsetting properties.  
    - A tibble shows you the first 10 rows when you print.  
    - You can extract by name or position using `$` or `[[]]`
    
```{r results=FALSE}
head(df_school$name)  
head(df_school[[4]])
```

**Quick data investigations**  

- The `glimpse()` functions allows you to see the number of rows (observations) and columns (variables) in the data frame/tibble. This function will print the columns and a few observations. 
```{r}
glimpse(df_school)
```
  
- `View()` function will open your data frame/tibble in a new tab.  
```{r}
View(df_school)
```
 
- `names()` function will print out all the names (variable names)in the data frame/tibble
```{r}
names(df_school)
```
  
- `head()` and `tail()` functions will print out the first 6 observations or the last six observations in your data frame/tibble.  
```{r}
head(df_school)  
tail(df_school)
```

# Tidyverse and Pipes   

## Tidyverse

**What is Tidyverse**  

- `Tidyverse` is a suite of packages designed for data science. All packages within Tidyverse share an underlying "philosophy, grammar, and data structures".   

`Tidyverse` includes the following packages: 

![](images/tidyverse.png)

*Credit: [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) R packages for data science*  

- We do not assume you have prior knowledge of any of the `Tidyverse` packages and will provide code throughout to help guide you.   

- To install run the following code chunk  
    - Remember that you only have to install a package once (that is why we have commented it out). You can uncomment the line below to install. 
```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- To load the `tidyverse` package, run the following code chunk
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Pipes

**What are "pipes", %>%**

- **Pipes** are a means of performing multiple steps in a single line of code

  - When writing code, the pipe symbol is `%>%`
  - The pipe operator `%>%` is created by the **magrittr** package, which is not part of base R
  - However, the magrittr package is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package  
  - keyboard shortcut (cmd + shift + m "Mac") or (control + shift + m "Windows") 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?magrittr::`%>%`
```

- pipe syntax: `LHS %>% RHS`
  
- `LHS` (refers to "left hand side" of the pipe) is an object or function 
- `RHS` (refers to "right hand side" of the pipe) is a function

**How pipes work:**

- Object created by `LHS` becomes the first argument of the function (`RHS`) to the right of the `%>%` pipe symbol 
- Basic code flow: `object %>% function1 %>% function2 %>% function3`    
- Output of `some_function1` becomes the input (the first argument) of the function `some_function2` to the right of the `%>%` pipe symbol 

Example of using pipes to calculate mean value of atomic vector
```{r}
1:10 # an atomic vector
mean(1:10) # calculate mean without pipes
1:10 %>% mean() # calculate mean with pipes
```
- no pipe: (1) write function; (2) data object `1:10` is 1st argument of `mean()`
- pipe: (1) write data object; (2) "pipe" (verb) object as 1st argument of `mean()` 


**Intuitive mnemonic device for understanding pipes**

- whenever you see a pipe `%>%` think of the words "__and then...__"


Example: isolate all the public schools [output omitted]

- in words: start with object `df_school` __and then__ filter for public schools 
```{r, results="hide"}
df_school %>% filter(school_type == "public") %>% head()
```
    
below code in words:

- start with `df_school` __and then__ select a few vars __and then__ filter __and then__ sort  __and then__ investigate structure of object
```{r}
df_school %>% select(name, school_type, state_code, avgmedian_inc_2564) %>% 
  filter(school_type == "public", state_code == "CA") %>% 
  arrange(desc(avgmedian_inc_2564)) %>% str()
```

# Functions

__What are functions__?

- **Functions** are pre-written bits of code that accomplish some task
- Functions allow you to "automate" tasks that you perform more than once
- We can call functions whenever we want to use them, again and again

__Functions generally follow three sequential steps__:

1. Take in __input__ object(s)
2. __Process__ the input
3. __Return__ a new object, which may be a vector, data-frame, plot, etc.


## Functions from packages written by others

<br>
__Example__: The `sum()` function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sum
```

1. __Input__: Takes in a vector of elements (_class_ must be `numeric` or `logical`)
2. __Processing__: Calculates the sum of elements
3. __Return__: Returns a numeric vector of length `1` whose value is the sum of the input vector
    - You can use `str()` to investigate the return value of the function

```{r}
# Apply sum() to atomic vector
sum(c(1,2,3))
sum(c(1,2,3)) %>% str()
```

## User-written functions

__What are "__user-written functions__"? [_Ozan's term_]__

- __User-written functions__ are functions _you_ write to perform some specific task
- It can often be for a data-manipulation or analysis task specific to your project

__Like all functions, user-written functions usually follow three steps__:

1. Take in one or more __input__ object(s)
2. __Process__ the input
    - This may include utilizing existing functions from other packages, for example `sum()` or `length()`
3. __Return__ a new object

__Three components of a function__:

1. __Function name__
    - Define a function using `function()` and give it a **name** using the assignment operator `<-`
2. __Function arguments__ (sometimes called "inputs")
    - Inputs that the function takes; they go inside the parentheses of `function()`
      - Can be vectors, data frames, logical statements, strings, etc.
    - In the above hypothetical code, the function took three inputs `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, but we could have written:
      - `function(x, y, z)` or `function(Larry, Curly, Moe)`
    - In the "function call," you specify values to assign to these function arguments
3. __Function body__
    - What the function does to the inputs
    - Function body goes inside the pair of curly brackets (`{}`) that follows `function()`
    - Above hypothetical function doesn't do anything, but your function can **return a value** (covered in [later section](#return-values))

### `print_hello()` function

__Task__: Write function called `print_hello()` that prints `"Hello, world."`

```{r}
print_hello <- function() {
  "Hello, world"
}

# Expected output
print_hello()
```

<details><summary>**Step 1**: Perform task outside of function</summary>
<br>

We want to print `"Hello, world"`:

```{r}
"Hello, world"
```

<br>
Alternative approaches to perform task outside of function:

```{r}
print("Hello, world")

str_c("Hello, world")
str_c("Hello, world", sep = "", collapse = NULL)
writeLines(str_c("Hello, world", sep = "", collapse = NULL))
```

</details>

<br>
<details><summary>**Step 2**: Create the function</summary>

<br>
```{r}
# Define function called `print_hello()`
print_hello <- function() {  # This function takes no arguments
  "Hello, world"             # The body of the function simply prints "Hello!"
}

# Call function
print_hello()

# Investigate return value
print_hello() %>% str()
```

1. __Function name__
    - Function name is `print_hello()`
2. __Function arguments__ (sometimes called "inputs")
    - `print_hello()` function doesn't take any arguments
3. __Function body__ (what the function does to the inputs)
    - Body of `print_hello()` simply prints "Hello, world"
    - **Return value**: The character value, `"Hello, world!"`

</details>

<br>

### `z_score()` function

The __z-score__ for an observation _i_ is the number of standard deviations away it is from the mean:

- $z_i = \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})}{\hat{\sigma}_x}$

__Task__: Write function called `z_score()` that calculates the z-score for each element of a vector

```{r, echo=-c(1:2)}
z_score <- function(x) {
  (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
}

# Expected output
z_score(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

<details><summary>**Step 1**: Perform task outside of function</summary>
<br>

Create a vector of numbers we'll use to calculate z-score:

```{r}
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
v

typeof(v)
class(v)
length(v)

v[1]  # 1st element of v
v[4]  # 4th element of v
```

<br>
We can calculate the z-score using the Base R `mean()` and `sd()` functions:

- $z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{sd(x)}$

```{r}
mean(v)
sd(v)
```

<br>
Calculate z-score for some value:

```{r}
(1-mean(v))/sd(v)
(4-mean(v))/sd(v)
```

<br>
Calculate z-score for particular elements of vector `v`:

```{r}
v[1]
(v[1]-mean(v))/sd(v)

v[4]
(v[4]-mean(v))/sd(v)
```

<br>
Calculate `z_i` for all elements of vector `v`:

```{r}
v
(v-mean(v))/sd(v)
```

</details>

<br>
<details><summary>**Step 2**: Write the function</summary>
<br>

Write function to calculate z-score for all elements of the vector:

```{r}
z_score <- function(x) {
  (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
}
```

1. __Function name__
    - Function name is `z_score`
2. __Function arguments__
    - `z_score()` function takes an object `x` as input to calculate the z-score for
3. __Function body__
    - Body of `z_score()` calculates z-score of input (e.g., For each element of `x`, calculate difference between value of element and mean value of elements, then divide by standard deviation of elements)
    - **Return value**: A numeric vector containing z-scores calculated from input

<br>
Test/call the function:

```{r}
z_score(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

  # investigate what function returns
  z_score(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) %>% str()

v
z_score(x = v)

seq(20, 25)
z_score(x = seq(20, 25))
  
  # investigate what function returns
  z_score(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) %>% str()
  
  #you could even create a new object whose values are the output/return of the function
  z_object <- z_score(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
  z_object
  z_object %>% str()
```

</details>
